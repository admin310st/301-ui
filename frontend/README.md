# Frontend

## What is this folder
Frontend entrypoint for 301.st user-facing UI, starting with authentication and prepared for a future dashboard.

## Current scope (MVP)
- Static auth page located in `/frontend/auth`.
- Interacts with `https://api.301.st/auth` endpoints (`login`, `register`, `me`, `refresh`, `logout`).

## Out of scope
- No SPA or routing.
- No Vue, Vite, Pinia, or Tailwind setup yet.

## Future plans
See `docs/ui-roadmap.ru.md` for the detailed roadmap (in Russian).
